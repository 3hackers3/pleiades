Resources and Reference Material
================================
Below is a collection of resources for specific computing and software
development resources we've curated in an attempt to provide a quick reference
page for anybody starting out on a project like this.

-----
Linux
-----
Just for reference, the `Linux Kernel Documentation 
<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/>`_ uses Read the Docs to host their
official documentation. So, if it's good enough for the kernel developers, it's
good enough for us.

The `Bash Reference Manual <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html>`_
is super helpful for learning how to write bash scripts for manipulating files,
running programs, and in general for executing things on the commandline.

The Linux `Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 
<https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html>`_ is a helpful
reference for how files are organized and common conventional uses of each
directory. Understanding the purpose of the handful of directories under the
root directory can go a long way towards helping you get comfortable with Linux
and give you more control over your system. Also, because what the hell is

Python
------
Python is the `most popular programming language <http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html>`_
and is still growing. There are many reasons for this including general purpose
capabilites as well as visualization toolkits and scientific computing
libraries that are all user-friendly (more or less). The current supported
version of Python is Python 3 as Python 2 support was ended in January 2020. 

--------------------------------
Scientific Computing with Python
--------------------------------
The recommended Python distribution for scientific computing and data analysis
is `Anaconda 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ as it provides a very
simple way to access many of most popular packages like numpy, scipy, pandas,
matplotlib, scikit-learn and tensorflow. In addition many third-party packages
are available for install through the conda package manager, including OpenMC.

Data Visualization

Git and Software Development
----------------------------
Git is a powerful tool for software development and version control for
projects of all sizes, big or small. There are a number of helpful tutorials
out there on how to use git,

Often times using git at the command line can be daunting for beginners.
However, having a good understanding of proper git workflows can go a long way
towards easing that anxiety. A very helpful reference that clearly explains a
good git workflow including branching, merging, and releases can be found `here
